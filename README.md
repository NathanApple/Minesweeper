For this assignment, i have created a minesweeper game. In minesweeper, the task is for the player to reveal every square without trigger any of the mine. If a player happen to reveal a mine, the game will end.

To start the game simply run the java program and this prompt will appear

When a mine is revealed, the game will end and all remaining mine will also be revealed

When all squares  without mine is revealed, the game will end and the rest of the square will be revealed
